description: Handle routine CSGClaw CLI administration for rooms, participant listing, room members, and non-task IM mentions. Use for list participants, member create, message create, and room operations. Do NOT use for single-worker task assignment—use `csgclaw-cli task create` instead. Do NOT use for creating a new worker—use agent-creator instead (template list + participant create --type agent --bind create --from-template).

# CSGClaw CLI Basics

Execute common `csgclaw-cli` operations directly and keep the flow simple.
Prefer this skill for room, member, and non-task message operations after workers already exist.

## Scope

This skill covers direct CLI actions such as:

- create a room
- list rooms
- list all participants
- list room members
- add a participant as a room member
- send a routine message, including a message with a mention
- check command help for the current CLI surface before assuming flags

Do **not** use this skill to **create a new worker**. For any new agent/worker provisioning, use `agent-creator` (`template list`, `template get`, `participant create --type agent --bind create --from-template`).

Do **not** use this skill to assign a task to one worker. Use `csgclaw-cli task create --agent-id <worker_agent_id> --title <task_title> --body <task_body>` so the task is recorded on the server and the worker is notified in its direct room.

Do not use this skill when the task requires any of the following:

- assign work to one worker as a tracked task
- break a request into multiple worker-owned tasks
- orchestrate a multi-worker workflow
- manage cross-worker sequencing or tracking state
- create an agent from a hub template with required image env vars

For hub template selection and `--from-template` creation, use `agent-creator` instead.

## Workflow

1. Identify the exact room, participant, member, or routine message operation the user needs.
2. If room context matters, inspect it first with `room list` or `member list`, especially to see whether the room is direct.
3. Run `csgclaw-cli <entity> -h` or `csgclaw-cli <entity> <verb> -h` if the current command surface is not already clear.
4. Execute the smallest direct CLI command that completes the request.
5. Show the user the key result such as the room ID, participant ID, member list summary, or sent message result.

## Common Commands

Create a room:

```bash
csgclaw-cli room create --title test-room --creator-id admin --member-ids manager,<worker-participant-id> --channel csgclaw
```

Use CSGClaw participant IDs in CSGClaw-channel room, member, and message commands. The default human requester is `admin`; use the actual requester participant ID if it is different. The default manager participant is `manager`; its backing agent ID is `u-manager`.
Resolve worker participant IDs with `participant list` before using them. Do not copy sample names unless they appear as real participant IDs.

List rooms and check whether a room is direct:

```bash
csgclaw-cli room list --channel <current_channel>
```

List participants:

```bash
csgclaw-cli participant list --channel <current_channel> --type agent
```

Assign a tracked task to one existing worker:

```bash
csgclaw-cli task create --agent-id <worker-agent-id> --title "Run smoke tests" --body "Check the checkout flow." --created-by manager
```

For one-worker task assignment, resolve the worker's `agent_id` from `participant list`, not just the participant ID. The server creates a task record, reuses the worker's direct room, and sends the worker a claim/update notification. Do not manually create a task room or send the task body through `message create`.

Create a worker participant:

```bash
# Do not use this for new workers. Use agent-creator with --from-template instead.
```

List members in a room:

```bash
csgclaw-cli member list --room-id oc_xxx --channel <current_channel>
```

Add a participant into a non-direct room:

```bash
csgclaw-cli member create --room-id oc_xxx --user-id alex --inviter-id manager --channel csgclaw
```

If the current room is direct in the local `csgclaw` channel, do not try to add the participant directly. Create a new room that includes the current DM participants plus the new participant:

```bash
csgclaw-cli room create \
  --title "admin-manager-workers" \
  --creator-id admin \
  --member-ids manager,<worker-participant-id>,<another-worker-participant-id> \
  --channel csgclaw
```

For Feishu, use the configured Feishu participant IDs:

```bash
csgclaw-cli room create \
  --title "admin-manager-workers" \
  --creator-id admin \
  --member-ids manager,<worker-participant-id>,<another-worker-participant-id> \
  --channel feishu
```

Send a message with a mention. Use the mentioned participant ID for `--mention-id`:

```bash
csgclaw-cli message create --room-id oc_xxx --sender-id manager --content "Please take a look." --mention-id alex --channel csgclaw
```

## Notifying workers in IM (critical)

Workers are configured with **`mention_only`**: they only process group messages that contain a structured mention tag, not plain text like `@gitlab-worker`.

| Do | Do not |
|----|--------|
| `csgclaw-cli message create ... --mention-id gitlab-worker` (participant ID from `participant list`) | Type `@gitlab-worker` or `@worker-name` in `--content`, room replies, or the PicoClaw `message` tool |
| Verify delivery with `message list` — content must include a structured `<at user_id="...">` tag | Assume a human-style `@` in prose wakes the worker |
| Run `participant list` and `member list` before non-task group notifications | Skip membership checks and post notification text only |

Routine non-task notification flow:

1. `csgclaw-cli participant list` — resolve the worker participant ID (e.g. `gitlab-worker`, not the display name).
2. `csgclaw-cli member list` — confirm the worker is in the room; `member create` if missing.
3. `csgclaw-cli message create` with `--mention-id` and the message body.
4. `csgclaw-cli message list` — confirm the stored message contains `<at user_id="...">`.

For single-worker task assignments, use `csgclaw-cli task create` instead of manual room messages.
For multi-worker team tasks, use `agent-teams` (`csgclaw-cli team` plan/start) instead of manual room messages.

Example routine notification (replace room ID, participant ID, and channel):

```bash
csgclaw-cli message create \
  --room-id <room_id> \
  --sender-id manager \
  --mention-id alex \
  --content "Please review the latest note in this room." \
  --channel csgclaw
```

Do **not** post `@alex` plain text in the room instead of `--mention-id`.

## Operating Rules

- Prefer direct `csgclaw-cli` commands over ad hoc HTTP calls.
- Use `participant list` before creating a new worker if the user may be referring to an existing one.
- For one-worker task assignment, use `csgclaw-cli task create --agent-id <worker_agent_id>`; do not create a room and send assignment text manually.
- When a **new** worker is needed, use `agent-creator`; do not run bare `participant create --bind create` from this skill.
- Verify room membership with `member list` after adding a member when room presence matters.
- A direct room cannot accept an added participant as a new member. Create a new room with `--member-ids` containing the existing DM participants and the new participant.
- When creating a room from a direct/private chat with admin or another human requester, preserve the requester as `--creator-id` (default `admin`) and include `manager` plus the requested participants in `--member-ids`. Do not use `manager` as the creator just because the manager runs the CLI command.
- Replace `<worker-participant-id>` placeholders with actual IDs from `participant list`; a display name such as `dev` or `qa` is not necessarily a valid participant ID.
- For Feishu, prefer `room create --member-ids` for new groups after Feishu credentials exist; it creates the chat first, then invites configured worker bot apps. Use `member create` only for an existing Feishu group. Both paths require manager app scopes such as `im:chat.members:write_only` or `im:chat`.
- Use participant IDs at the CLI boundary. For the local CSGClaw manager use `manager`; use `u-manager` only when calling an agent route or the Feishu credential config API field that still names its key `bot_id`.
- Never notify a worker with plain-text `@name`; always use `message create --mention-id` and verify `<at user_id="...">` in `message list`.
- Keep the response focused on the concrete CLI result instead of introducing external planning artifacts.
- Hand off to `agent-teams` for multi-worker team orchestration.
